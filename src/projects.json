The logo was created by combining a robot with magnets to represent the idea of demand generation. The electricity bolts from the logo were then used to create a background pattern and as decorative design elements. To promote the event, I also designed and coded the event microsite and created all the marketing assets including email and social media graphics. ",

In 2024 they decided to bring the event back and I was tasked to create the event branding and promotional assets. A badge logo was created along with a background pattern. The colors were made to mimic the classic No.2 pencil and a scribble graphic was made as a design element to create accents and callouts. To promote the event, I also designed and coded the event microsite and created all the marketing assets including email and social media graphics.",

My ultimate solution was to use a penrose triangle to represent the concept of sanpo yoshi and the interconnectedness of his service to his clientele’s businesses.",
